      <h1>What is Sandstone</h1>
      <p>Sandstone is our defined style and form for Web properties. Combining
      set visual styles, UX elements, and a responsive grid system, it creates
      a cohesive brand experience across all our websites. You can learn more
      about it in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/styleguide/websites/sandstone/">Mozilla style guide</a>.</p>

      <h2>Responsive grids</h2>
      <p>The default grid system for Sandstone is 12 columns at a width of 940px,
      where each column is 60px wide with 20px gutters. Those gutters are achieved
      with 10px margins on the left and right of the columns so elements can span columns
      and float next to each other in an endless variety of configurations.</p>

      <p>The columns switch to 40px wide for smaller viewports, those between 760px
      and 480px wide. For especially small viewports &ndash; namely smartphones or
      other handheld mobile devices &ndash; the grid drops to 5 columns at 40px and
      most content is allowed to stack vertically rather than float side by side. Bear
      this in mind when you arrange your content so it can maintain a sensible flow in
      both configurations.</p>

      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>The secondary heading above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any
      form of important page-level heading. Primary titles, such as the page title or the title
      of this article can be <code>h1</code> elements. In HTML5, each new section element in a document
      establishes a new context with a new heading hierarchy, so it's perfectly acceptable to
      have more than one <code>h1</code> on a single page, but there should generally be as few
      as possible.</p>

      <p>Use headings in the correct order to indicate hierarchy and the relative importance
      of the content they introduce.</p>

      <h3>Third-Level Heading</h3>
      <p>The heading above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of
      page-level heading which falls below the <code>h2</code> heading in a document hierarchy.</p>

      <h4>Fourth-Level Heading</h4>
      <p>For all headings below third-level, follow the guidelines listed above.
      Only use lower heading levels when necessary.</p>

      <h5>Fifth-Level Heading</h5>
      <p>For all headings below third-level, follow the guidelines listed above.
      Only use lower heading levels when necessary.</p>

      <h6>Sixth-Level Heading</h6>
      <p>For all headings below third-level, follow the guidelines listed above.
      Only use lower heading levels when necessary.</p>

      <h3>Sidebar</h3>
      <p>Some pages may have optional sidebars to contain supplemental content or navigation.
      Sidebars typically wrap under the main column in mobile viewports, and should always be
      considered secondary to the main intent of the page. If a sidebar contains vital and
      essential content, then perhaps that content shouldn't be in a sidebar.</p>

      <nav>
        <h4>Sidebar Navigation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Page One</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Page Two</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Page Three</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
